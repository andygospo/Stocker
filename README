STOCKER DESCRIPTION

Stocker is  a stock alert application built in Java.  Using this program, you can monitor various stocks and set high and low threshold values, so when a specific stock goes outside its specified range, you will be alerted with an email.

For help with setup and troubleshooting see the documents in the Docs folder.  The Docs folder has directions for how things work as they stand now.  There are also current links to helpful websites if further assistance is needed.
